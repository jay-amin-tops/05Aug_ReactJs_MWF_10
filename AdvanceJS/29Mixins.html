    <p>In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. There can be only one [[Prototype]] for an object. And a
        class may extend only one other class.</p>

    <p>But sometimes that feels limiting. For instance, we have a class StreetSweeper and a class Bicycle, and want to
        make their mix: a StreetSweepingBicycle.</p>

    <p>Or we have a class User and a class EventEmitter that implements event generation, and weâ€™d like to add the
        functionality of EventEmitter to User, so that our users can emit events.</p>
    <script>
        // mixin
        let sayHiMixin = {
            sayHi() {
                alert(`Hello ${this.name}`);
            },
            sayBye() {
                alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);
            }
        };
        class User {
            constructor(name) {
                this.name = name;
            }
        }

        Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);
        new User("Dude").sayHi(); // Hello Dude!
